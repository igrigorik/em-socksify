# EM-Socksify: Transparent proxy support for any EventMachine protocol

Dealing with SOCKS proxies is pain. EM-Socksify provides a simple shim to setup & negotiate a SOCKS5 connection for any EventMachine protocol. To add SOCKS support, all you have to do is include the module and provide your destination address.

## Example: Routing HTTP request via SOCKS5 proxy

```ruby
class Handler < EM::Connection
  include EM::Socksify

  def connection_completed
    socksify('google.ca', 80) do
      send_data "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nConnection:close\r\nHost: google.ca\r\n\r\n"
    end
  end

  def receive_data(data)
    p data
  end
end

EM.run do
  EventMachine.connect SOCKS_HOST, SOCKS_PORT, Handler
end
```

What's happening here? First, we open a raw TCP connection to the SOCKS proxy (after all, all data will flow through it). Then, we provide a Handler connection class, which includes "EM::Socksify". Once the TCP connection is established, EventMachine calls the **connection_completed** method in our handler. Here, we call socksify with the actual destination host & port (address that we actually want to get to), and the module does the rest.

After you call socksify, the module temporarily intercepts your receive_data callbacks, negotiates the SOCKS connection (version, authentication, etc), and then once all is done, returns the control back to your code. Simple as that.

For SOCKS proxies which require authentication, use:

```ruby
socksify(destination_host, destination_port, username, password, version)
```

## Example: Routing HTTPS request via a squid CONNECT proxy

```ruby
class Handler < EM::Connection
  include EM::Connectify

  def connection_completed
    connectify('www.google.ca', 443) do
      start_tls
      send_data "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nConnection:close\r\nHost: www.google.ca\r\n\r\n"
    end
  end

  def receive_data(data)
    p data
  end
end

EM.run do
  EventMachine.connect PROXY_HOST, PROXY_PORT, Handler
end
```

For CONNECT proxies which require authentication, use:

```ruby
connectify(destination_host, destination_port, username, password)
```
